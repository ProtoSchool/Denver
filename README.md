# Denver Protoschool Chapter

## Welcome! :grinning: :wave:

---

Denver's Protoschool Chapter is a group *passionate* about all things enabling the **Decentralized Web**. :computer:

This group is centered on education, outreach and connecting to the *community* of Colorado individuals of like mind. 

We focus on tools built by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai), but are more than open to all decentralized compute, storage, and networking technologies! 

Join us to learn, to evangelize, or just to get to know us. Everyone is welcome here!
